Hello there!

My name is Jack Eilles, or ArykDev on GitHub.

I am currently a student, enrolled at New College Durham studying a T-Level Qualification in IT.

Currently, I have a project to create a shell for Linux, written in Python, with support for popular shells like BASH and ZSH, along with integrating support for shell theming programs by https://github.com/robbyrussell
