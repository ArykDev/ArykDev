Hello there!

My name is Jack Eilles, or ArykDev on GitHub.

I am currently a student, enrolled at New College Durham studying a T-Level Qualification in Digital Production, Design and Development.

Currently, I have a project to create a shell for Linux, written in Python, with support for popular shells like BASH and ZSH, along with integrating support for shell theming programs by https://github.com/robbyrussell

I have also completed a project, which is a utility to allow people to easily restart their computer by making use of the `kexec` utility in linux, I am planning to implement further features in the future such as selecting an installed kernel to reboot to, and displaying a GRUB like TUI to select.
